The IMVU 3D Avatar Chat client allows users to create custom avatars and rooms and chat together in a 3D space. In addition to the chat experience, users can create and submit their own 3D products with interactive Flash widgets attached to the experience.

This project contains the ActionScript 3 API for creating interactive multi-user widgets for the IMVU 3D Avatar Chat client.
